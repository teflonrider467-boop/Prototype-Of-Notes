<!-- Basics Of Web Development -->
<!-- Challenge that Web solves: Communication Gap -->
<!-- Let's say Jim is from USA and Bob is from AUSTRALIA, Jim wants to buy a phone at cheap price and Bob wants to sell a phone at cheap price -->
<!-- Challenge 1: Does Jim and Bob speak the same language -->
<!-- Challenge 2: How Jim can find Bob -->

<!-- Protocol (How to solve Challenge-1) -->
<!-- In the Above problem Jim and Bob would first have an Agreement of the language,
    which is nothing but a set of rules,
    So in terms of Protocols,
    Protocols is nothing but a set of rules that defines how communication can happen between two devices,

    Similarly for a system to communicate they have to follow a Protocol,
    For example think of a T.V. and a Remote,
    they are programmed in Infrared Protocol;
    think of wifi and phone,
    they are programmed in Wi-Fi Protocol;

    When Jim and Bob wants to communicate each other on their PC,
    They use TCP/IP;-->

<!-- Internet(How to solve Challenge-2) -->
<!-- Internet is a network where group of computers are connected with a single wire
     Systems connected over the internet are able to communicate with each other and exchange data;
     TCP/IP Protocol is agreed upon to connect to internet -->

<!-- TCP/IP -->
<!-- When we connect to the internet we agree upon a set of rules,
These rules also make us agree to have a unique number which will make it easier to find us
This unique number is called IP address, It looks something like: 192.87.45.20;
Go to command Prompt and write `ipconfig` to know about your IP address
write ping www.yahoo.com to know the IP address of Yahoo,
with different computers we find out that we get different IP address for www.google.com or for any other website,
this is because we might be reaching a different google server at different positions as google has many servers,
Now IP address of Each computer or a server cannot be remembered, hence we use DNS to solve that issue  -->

<!-- DNS(Domain Name Service), also known as Host Name -->
<!-- DNS is nothing but an English name, which means an area, that is easy to remember,
think of your contacts, you may not remember the phone Number of you friend so to access them you write their number and store it under there name
IP address is like the Contact Number whereas DNS is like the Contact Name
Domain Name has to be Unique, and for it to be Unique you have to buy
There are two types of seller who sells Domain Names
1. Web Hosting Provider(Digital Ocean, BlueHost, HostGator)(They sell space in the server, that is, IP Address is shared)
2. Domain Name Provider(GoDaddy)
DNS Server is used to convert a Domain name to IP Address
When a user write a domain name such as www.facebook.com, the nearby DNS(Domain name system) servers convert the domain name into IP Address and fetch the data-->

<!-- HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) -->
<!-- The TCP/IP protocol does not care what type of data is being sent it just sends zeroes and ones,
The HTTP protocol is used to transfer data like Hyper Text(Images, Videos over the Internet)
HTTP depends on TCP/IP to transfer the data but how the data should be transferred, what kind of data is basically handled by HTTP -->

<!-- Web Servers listen to the HTTP requests, and sends the response of those requests -->
<!-- The HTTPS request and response are handle through a web server
    Some of the most used web servers are:-
1. NGINX
2. Apache
3. CloudFlare Server
4. LiteSpeed
5. Microsoft-IIS
6. Node.JS
 -->

<!-- Browser is a tool that help us render website -->

<!-- There are 3 types of Languages
1. Programming Language(uses Compiler): C, C++, Java(There job is to interact with the machine and Hardware)
2. Scripting Language(uses Interpreter): PHP, JavaScript, Python, Ruby(They are Built on Top of the Programming Languages)
3. Markup Language: HTML, XML(They are used to mark up the details in the files like linking up a resource or to display a content or to link another file in the server) -->
<!-- In Compiling languages, we write our code then we compile our code which gets us a machine level code that gets executed -->
<!-- In Interpreted languages we don't need to compile our code, it gets executed as the file is running -->

<!-- HTML stands fot Hyper Text Markup Language -->
<!-- Hyper Text refers to all the images, text, videos and all those data that is being transferred over the internet -->
<!-- Markup language refers to the language using which you mark the content or the purpose of the content -->
<!-- So the language used in order to Markup the Hyper Text is called Hyper Text Markup Language  -->
<!-- HTML is used to describe the structure of the web page -->
<!-- The main purpose of HTML is to embed resource on the server in an organized manner and display itself to the Client once it is called -->
<!-- HTML is not case sensitive which means <p></p> is not different from <P></P> -->

<!-- BoilerPlate is the amount of code that is necessary -->
<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- It tells which version of html 5 is being used -->
<html lang="en"> <!-- It Specifies the primary language for the website, that is also used by voice generation tools to red out the content for blind users -->
<head> <!-- The head section content is not visible except the title -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8"> <!-- It ensures that the character used in the website is displayed correctly -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> <!-- It tells how to display your website when it first opens -->
    <meta name="description content=This is a tutorial on HTML"><!-- This is used to write description in google -->
    <meta name="keywords" content="html5, learning, web, PHP">
    <title>Document</title> <!-- It gets displayed in the tab of the website -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./learnCSS.css"><!-- It links the external CSS file to the document, the `rel` attribute is necessary without it the browser does not know what to do with the file resource attached to the HTML -->
